# IMPORTANT NOTE
# ---------------
# This file is updated between versions. (B1.5.0 now)
# Keep that in mind if you want to maintain translations.
# It might also contain some secrets... so tread lightly.
# 
# Also, I recommend removing these guide comments on the translations.
# Use Spanish (spa) for reference on how to make new languages.

# LANGUAGE MERGING

# In this mod, if multiple language files have
# the same lang value, they will merge:

lang = "en"

# This means you can split a single language
# into several .txt files, as long as you define
# the same "lang = ..." somewhere in the file.
