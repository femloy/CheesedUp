The "en" folder name corresponds with the value set in english.txt. If you have a Spanish translation with <lang = "spa"> in it, you make a folder just named "spa", without the quotes.

You can only replace the sprites that are in the existing "en" folder. Just copy them over to your own folder.

The replacement sprite needs be exported as a sprite sheet, with the same canvas width and frame count as the original sprite. That is, unless you add extra info into the data.ini:

[sprite_name]
images = <frame count>
xoffset = <horizontal center/origin point>
yoffset = <vertical center/origin point>

Doing that bypasses the requirements before. They basically work like CYOP sprites, if you're used to those.

You can also use GIFs but they're extremely slow. Don't use GIFs unless you're willing to wait 2 minutes for your language to load each time.

* Make sure custom_graphics in the .txt is set to true
* spr_lang_flag.png for the flag shown in the menu
* Make a spr_lang_name.png to make the name in the menu a sprite instead of text (194x57)
