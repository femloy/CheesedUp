You have to fork the "mod-loader-template" branch in Cheesed Up's FMOD specifically.

*** You CAN'T use ANY other FMOD project! ***

https://github.com/femloy/CU-FMOD/tree/mod-loader-template

Things to note:
- The filenames don't matter, the game loads all banks it can find.
- Subfolders are ignored, so you can put the .fspro in a folder here too.
